  <p>This policy is only applicable for Latin America region.</p>
  <p>Procedure for Refund:</p>

  <p>These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in USA, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that USA, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p>
  <p>Arbitration</p>
  <p><b>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM GUPSHUP.</b>For any dispute with Gupshup, you agree to first contact us at legal@gupshup.io and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Gupshup has not been able to resolve a dispute after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), shall be referred to a sole Arbitrator as appointed by Gupshup in accordance with Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or any statutory modifications or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The venue of such arbitration shall be at Mumbai and the award of the Arbitrator shall be binding on both the parties. If you are using the Gupshup Content or Gupshup Platform for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any Arbitration filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Gupshup Content or Gupshup Platform for non-commercial purposes: (i) Gupshup may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from Gupshup; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Gupshup from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.</p>
  <p>Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</p>
  <p>WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE GUPSHUP CONTENT OR GUPSHUP PLATFORM FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND GUPSHUP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</p>
  <p>General Legal Terms.</p>

You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the Gupshup Content and the Gupshup Platform.</p>
  <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall constitute a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Gupshup failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
  <p>These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Gupshup without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
  <p>These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Gupshup in connection with the Gupshup Content or Gupshup Platform, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Gupshup concerning the Gupshup Content and Gupshup Platform.</p>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</p>
